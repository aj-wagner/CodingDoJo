            <h2>What is Git?</h2> 
                <p>
                   Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots commits) of your code base  With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.  During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a presvious snapshots you took or merge those experiments into your app. 
                </p>   
            <h2>What is GitHub?</h2> 
                <p>
                    GitHub is acode hosting platform for version control and collaboration.  It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.

                        <span class="greenTxt">Git init</span> is the act of registering this current code base.

                        <span class="greenTxt">Git add</span> is how we stage the intergration of our currrent code base into our current list of snapshots

                        <span class="greenTxt">Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online respository where we can place all of our current code.  This is where the outside world can see our code base.

                        <span class="greenTxt">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our respositories.  Other developer might look at our existing porjects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add
